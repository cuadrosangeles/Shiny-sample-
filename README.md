# Shiny
This repository contains a Shiny dashboard sample regarding Covid-19 in Chicago

+ This Shiny dashboard shows basic information regarding the Covid-19 pandemic impact in Chicago between 2020 and 2022. It uses official data from https://data.cityofchicago.org/ 
+ The first block will show data distribution regarding Covid-19 deaths by Covid-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) levels.
+ Select between low, medium, or high CCVI levels and check how those levels distribute covid-19 deaths data.
+ Later, you'll be able to observe the number of deaths regarding Covid-19 in Chicago by Zip code during the pandemic on a map. 
+ Optionally, you can select the same map and visualize its streets. Both maps were elaborated with ggplot2.
+ The final dashboard is uploaded in shinyapps.io. Please take a look at it at https://t7qixt-oscar-cuadros.shinyapps.io/homework-2-cuadrosangeles/

+ I designed the Shiny dashboard as part of the Data and Programming for Public Policy II lecture at the University of Chicago. Coding is at app.R file.
